            <h3>Traveling With Your Dog</h3>
            <p>
              I fell in the mud as I was walking home from school today.
              I wanted to flirt with the barista, but suddenly, I couldn't find my tongue.
              I like blueberries and mangoes but not strawberries.
              Suddenly from under the stove there came a squeak.
            </p>
            <p>
              I didn't know what to wear to my best friend's funeral.
              I'm taking a little road trip to Oklahoma City this morning.
              Tom realized he could be making a big mistake.
              He had a dream so real that he woke screaming.
